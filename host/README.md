Scripts to help running a game.

This isn't a conventional written Python application,
but rather a collection of scripts that can be run in a Python environment.

The scripts are nothing fancy and use very common libraries.
So, as long as you're with Python 3.10+ you should be fine.

The scripts are also not very well written so don't take it too seriously.
