## Getting Started

To start developing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note that it runs `vite dev --host` under the hood to allow access from other devices on the same network.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This app is configured with GitHub Actions to deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
See also the [GitHub Actions workflow file](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
